pixLayout was created to facilitate maximally the work of the pixel layout designer and measuring distances and margins.

pixLayout is a picture-layer, which can be managed by the panel at the top right corner of the document window, hotkeys, or just by moving it with the mouse. At any time, the panel can be hidden or completely liquidate the whole html and css of the plugin.
